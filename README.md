Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Karl, exploring the intersection of AI, cloud, and intelligent systems. I love working on problems where AI meets real-world impact. Always learning, always building :-).

A couple projects others have found useful:
- [ProSeCo Planning - Probabilistic Semantic Cooperative Planning](https://github.com/ProSeCo-Planning) (Ph.D. Thesis)
- [Hybrid A* path planner](https://github.com/karlkurzer/path_planner) (Master's Thesis)
